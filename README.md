# us-de-xkbmap
The keyboard layout I use.

# Features

It's an English (US) keyboard layout, with the addition that you can use `AltGr` to produce German characters:

`AltGr + u` => `ü`
`AltGr + s` => `ß`
...

# How to try it?

Copy the map `jannis` (you are free to rename it of course) to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` and execute:

```
setxkbmap jannis
```
